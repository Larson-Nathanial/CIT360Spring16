MVC pattern

This is another pattern that is used in architecture of software products.

It is the idea of seperating the pieces of an application into three distinct parts - Model, View and Controller.

In a typical pattern, the View is responsible for displaying content to the User.  The User interacts with the controller, 
which will talk to the Model, which will update the view.

It can be kind of confusing to understand especially because most applications don't follow just one architectural approach
or even a defined architectural approach at all, in the real world. 

Here is a link to a diagram that shows what a typical MVC pattern looks like:
